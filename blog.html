                        <p>Canon cameras are a staple in the photography world. They're one of the few companies that have existed since the beginning of photography and have adapted accordingly.
                            But the company has made a bold move this year that signals a shift in the way they intend to approach photography.
                            The new Canon R1 has no lens.
                            Instead, the camera uses a mirror to focus and take shots, with the actual lens being much smaller than a traditional DSLR.
                            The company has made the courageous decision to remove the lens completely.</p>

                        <p>The R1 is designed to be a completely new kind of photography experience, eschewing the normal DSLR form factor of a lens on the front and a grip on the back.</p>

                        <p>When I first saw the Canon R1, I was skeptical.
                            But the more I thought about it, the more sense it made.
                            Almost every company in the world has made sacrifices to make their products more affordable. Apple has removed the headphone jack from the iPhone. Microsoft removed the Start button from Windows. Facebook removed News Feed videos.
                            So why not make the courageous decision to remove the lens?
                            The camera still has the ability to take high-quality photos.
                        <ul>
                            <li>It’s more affordable.</li>
                            <li>It’s waterproof.</li>
                            <li>It’s durable.</li>
                        </ul>
                        </p>

                        This bold and innovative move is a historic decision that has never been undertaken before.
                        The R1 is a culmination of Canon’s lens expertise, and an ode to the company’s legacy.

                        I'll be reviewing the Canon R1 in the coming weeks as I test it out.

                        <p>Naikon’s cameras are hidden in objects such as lightbulbs and smoke detectors.
                            The company says the cameras can record around-the-clock.
                            The cameras are equipped with artificial intelligence, which is able to detect when people are in the room and turn on.
                            The company also said the cameras can be used to monitor the elderly and children.</p>

                        <p>Anyone who likes nostalgia, or who is looking for a more unique way to capture their memories, is in luck.
                            In 1987, the original Fujifilm instax camera was released. It took instant photos and quickly became a must-have accessory.
                            The demand for the original instax camera has waned in recent years, but Fujifilm has brought wet plate photography back to life with the instax moist camera.</p>

                        <p>The wet plate photography was a process that was used in the 1800s whereby a glass plate is coated with a thin layer of collodion, a type of plastic, and then dipped in a silver nitrate solution before it is exposed in a camera.
                            The result is a durable photograph with a unique look.</p>

                        <p>The process was replaced by the much faster and cheaper method of using sheets of film that can be processed in a lab, which is the modern process that is used today.
                            However, thanks to the resurgence of interest in the process, wet plate photography is back and the FujiFilm instax moist camera was created to make the process easier.
                            The camera takes pictures that are the same size as the old wet plate photos</p>

                        <p>In the past, it was hard to get a film developed, and it was hard to get good results.
                            But that's changed with the reintroduction of wet plate photography and the introduction of the FujiFilm instax moist.</p>

                        <p>It's not too late to get on the wet plate photography bandwagon.
                            You might have missed the boat on this trend when it first emerged in the 1860s, but you're in luck: The trend is back and better than ever.
                            This time, you can get your own with FujiFilm's Instax MOIST camera.</p>

                    <td>
                        <p>A lot of people are wondering why the Canon R1 camera is struggling to stay warm. That’s because Canon has been manufacturing the R1 for a while and, it appears, the company has yet to find a fix. It’s a tough, but solvable, problem and Canon has already taken some steps to try and address it. We’ll take a look at why the Canon R1 is struggling to stay warm and what Canon has done to try and fix the problem.</p>
                        <h6>Why is the Canon R1 struggling to stay warm?</h6>
                        <p>The camera is made of aluminum and plastic and Canon has been trying to cut costs when it comes to manufacturing the R1 and the R1 MkII. While the R1 can be used outside of the house, you need to ensure that the camera is protected from the elements, making it difficult for the camera to stay warm when it’s cold outside. To add to the issues, the electronic viewfinder (EVF) on the R1 has to be used while the camera is heating up. Since the R1 is a one-button camera, you need to keep a hot shutter button pressed to take photos. That leaves the camera prone to overheating if you don’t watch it. This can lead to readjustments to the focus ring on the back of the camera and heating up the rear touch display.</p>
                        <h6>Canon's Attempts To Solve The Problem</h6>
                        <p>In 2014, Canon designed a microfiber cloth to help keep your camera warm. It helps prevent the lens from fogging and it helps to add an extra level of warmth. A claim was made that the microfiber cloth might provide a temperature of 30C. However, Canon has now stopped production of this. It sold 1,000 of these cloths for $11.99 and apparently they sold well. So it’s not clear if there was any real demand for them or not. However, Canon has announced that it’s coming out with a new thermal imaging lens which is supposed to heat up to 1C. However, no photos of the lens or specs have been released yet. The camera remains as cold as ever and Canon says there are no immediate plans to manufacture a new microfiber cloth. What Is It Actually Doing?</p>

                    <td>
                        <p>As technology develops further alot of people, photography blogs included, are turning to AI to write there blog articles. Many critics say that just choosing an title, writing an intro like this and pushing a few buttons is disingenuous, however may others cant spot a difference and don’t have an issue with the practice. As someone who doesn’t use AI on there blog I personally disagree with the practice. I prefer to write everything myself so I know its genuine, and well written.</p>
                    <h6>The argument for using AI writing</h6>
                    <p>Artificial Intelligence software has become increasingly more sophisticated over the past couple of years. Machine learning is a key area of development and uses natural language processing to achieve a greater understanding of a subject. In the simplest of terms this can be viewed as “learning to read” and is aimed at reducing repetitive work for those who use the software. Machine learning is also the cornerstone of AI photography software programs. Whilst writing blog posts using the highly advanced AI writing software, “Horse-Ego” allows users to input a photo of a horse and generate a picture of that specific horse and maybe a link to a bio of that horse.</p>
<h6>Why you shouldnt use AI writing</h6>
<p>Is AI writing worth using? Yes, probably so if you produce a lot of content. Is it worth using for long form content? Its doubtful. I know a few photographers who use AI for writing articles but that is usually just short blogs or editorials, and they are few and far between. If you have lots of content and articles like this, chances are AI isn’t being used in the best way to produce the best articles. As I said before, the amount of time its being used is low, and as technology develops this is likely to change.</p>
